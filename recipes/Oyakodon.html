    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Oyakodon is a delicious traditional Japanese meal consisting of chicken sautéed and then cooked in a Japanese broth, and then finished with egg and served over rice. It's really easy, filling, and delicious.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>

        <li>4 skinless, boneless chicken thighs, cut into small pieces</li>
            
        <li>1 onion, cut in half and sliced</li>
            
        <li>2 cups dashi stock, made with dashi powder</li>
            
        <li> ¼ cup soy sauce</li>
            
        <li>3 tablespoons mirin (Japanese rice wine)</li>
            
        <li> 3 tablespoons brown sugar</li>
            
        <li> 4 large eggs</li>
            
        <li>4 cups hot cooked white rice</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add chicken and cook until beginning to brown, about 5 minutes. Add onion; cook and stir until onion is translucent, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Pour in stock, then whisk in soy sauce, mirin, and brown sugar; stir until sugar dissolves. Bring to a boil, then lower heat and simmer until slightly reduced, about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Whisk eggs in a bowl until well-beaten, then pour into the hot stock mixture. Cover the skillet, reduce the heat, and steam until egg is cooked, about 5 minutes. Remove from the heat</li>
